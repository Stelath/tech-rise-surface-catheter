# Tech Rise Surface Catheter

### Project Leads: Alex Korte & Ryan Teachman

### What is this?

This repository houses the Arduino program designed to collect and store data for our NASA Tech Rise Surface Catheter experiment.

## NASA Tech Rise

NASA Tech Rise was a student challenge ranging from 6th-12th grade where participating teams could submit an experiment proposal to be carried out in space on a Blue Origin Rocket or Weather Ballon.

## Our Proposal

Our team submitted a proposal for a Surface Catheter that could aid in zero gravity surgery. Unlike in Earth's gravity, during surgery in space, blood would begin to pool and float around outside of the incision site. Not only could floating blood pose problems for a surgeon operating on a patient if their view of the incision site is obstructed by blood. But the surgeon may also risk contamination of their environment if blood is allowed to free float around the cabin. To combat this, we proposed a vacuum-like device that could suck up floating blood during surgery. This idea was concieved by Ryan Teachman while working with MUSC researcher Dr. Donna Roberts.

## Making our Experiment

Starting the project we had a very tight time constraint of four months before the experiment had to be shipped to NASA. To meet this time constraint we utilized the Engineering Design Process, Constant Testing, and Rapid Prototyping. We also broke up our group into sub-teams, each focused on a different portion of the experiment. Ryan Teachman led the physical product design, funds management, and commincation with NASA; while Alex Korte led the software and electrical teams. Both project leaders worked on systems management. Each sub-team was given certain constraints so that the integration of parts during the final assembly would be seamless. This destructured aspect allowed each team to efficiently design, develop, and test their parts without being bottlenecked by other teams' progress on their designs.
